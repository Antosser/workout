# WorkoutAngular
A much better looking and working workout app than the old one

## Includes
* Streaks
* Adding removing exercises
* Moving them up and down
* A fancy timer / progress bar
* Good bootstrap design

## Installation
* Download angular
* Navigate into the project's directory
* Run `ng serve` and open http://localhost:4200 in your browser

I do not host any servers, so this is the only way to use this app

## Usage
* Add some exercises using the `Add another exercise` button and change their names and durations
* You can delete or move the exercises using the buttons on the right
* To start exercising click the `Start today's workout` button on the top
* This will take you to another page. You'll need to click the `Staqrt` button there too
* Do the exercise while the time is running out
* Once you're done with all of them your streak will increase by 1

## Streak system
* Streak is reset if the last time you exercised was before yesterday
* Streak is increased by 1 if you finished exercising and you did not exercise that day
